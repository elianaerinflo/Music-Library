        [Intro]
        (Ooh, ah-ah)
        (Ooh, ah-ah)
        
        [Verse 1]
        If you weren't born with it
        You can buy a couple ornaments
        Just be sure to read the warning, kids
        'Cause pretty soon you'll be bored of it, ha-ha
        Sexual, hey girl, if you wanna feel sexual
        You can always call up a professional
        They stick pins in you like a vegetable, ha-ha

        [Pre-Chorus]
        Kids forever, kids forever
        Baby soft skin turns into leather
        Don't be dramatic, it's only some plastic
        No one will love you if you're unattractive

        [Chorus]
        Oh, Mrs. Potato Head, tell me
        Is it true that pain is beauty?
        Does a new face come with a warranty?
        Will a pretty face make it better?
        Oh, Mr. Potato Head, tell me
        How did you afford her surgery?
        Do you swear you'll stay forever?
        Even if her face don't stay together

        [Post-Chorus]
        Ooh, ah-ah
        (Even if her face don't stay together)
        Ooh, ah-ah

        [Verse 2]
        If you want a little more confidence
        Potatoes turn to French fries, yeah, it's common sense
        All you need's a couple more condiments
        And a hundred thousand dollars for some compliments, ha-ha
        It's such a waste
        When little girls grow into their mother's face
        But little girls are learning how to cut and paste
        And pucker up their lips until they suffocate, ha-ha

        [Pre-Chorus]
        Kids forever, kids forever
        Baby soft skin turns into leather
        Don't be dramatic, it's only some plastic
        No one will love you if you're unattractive

        [Chorus]
        Oh, Mrs. Potato Head, tell me
        Is it true that pain is beauty?
        Does a new face come with a warranty?
        Will a pretty face make it better?
        Oh, Mr. Potato Head, tell me
        How did you afford her surgery?
        Do you swear you'll stay forever?
        Even if her face don't stay together

        [Post-Chorus]
        Stay forever, stay forever
        Even if her face don't stay together
        Stay forever, stay forever
        Even if her face don't stay together
        Ooh, ah-ah
        Ooh, ah-ah

        [Chorus]
        Oh, Mrs. Potato Head, tell me
        Is it true that pain is beauty?
        Does a new face come with a warranty?
        Will a pretty face make it better?
        Oh, Mr. Potato Head, tell me
        How did you afford her surgery?
        Do you swear you'll stay forever?
        Even if her face don't stay together

        [Post-Chorus]
        Stay forever, stay forever
        Even if her face don't stay together
        Stay forever, stay forever
        Even if her face don't stay together
        Stay forever, stay forever
        Even if her face don't stay together
        Stay forever, stay forever
        Even if her face don't stay together

        [Outro]
        (Ooh, ah-ah)
        (Ooh, ah-ah)

        <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;MEANING OF THE LYRICS &nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
    </legend>
    <pre>

        Melanie references the 90s toy “Mrs Potatohead” which has several stick-on features to represent women 
        who alter their body parts with plastic surgeries. In doing so, she questions if they feel happy knowing 
        that such actions cannot be reversed. The reason she believes these women change their natural look is to
        feel more confident and fit in the media's portrayal of beauty. However, the end result is a permanent 
        feeling of uncertainty about one's own looks and whether a significant other will still be with them when 
        their altered parts begin to deteriorate.

        Lyrically, the song deals with plastic surgery, its consequences, and the struggle for beauty in the 
        modern world, especially for women.

        She explained that the song was not about her criticizing women who get plastic surgery, but rather
        questioning them on why they do it when they are actually more beautiful naturally.
