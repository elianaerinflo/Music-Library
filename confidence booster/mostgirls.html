    [Intro]
    (They're staying out late 'cause they just celebrating)
    (They're staying out late 'cause they just celebrating)

    [Verse 1]
    Some girls feel best in their tiny dresses
    Some girls, nothing but sweatpants, looking like a princess
    Some girls kiss new lips every single night
    They're stayin' out late 'cause they just celebrating life

    [Pre-Chorus]
    You know some days you feel so good in your own skin
    But it's okay if you wanna change the body that you came in
    'Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen
    We're all just playing a game in a way, trying to win at life

    [Chorus]
    Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful
    Most girls work hard, go far, we are unstoppable
    "Most girls": Our fight to make every day, no two are the same
    I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
    I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
    I wanna be like, I wanna be like

    [Post-Chorus]
    They're staying out late 'cause they just celebrating
    I wanna be like, I wanna be like
    They're staying out late cause they just celebrating
    I wanna be like, I wanna be like

    [Verse 2]
    Some girls like to keep their physique real private
    Some girls wear jeans so tight 'cause it feels so right, yeah
    Some girls, every day searching, keep the page turning
    Sleeping in late 'cause they just celebrating life (Oh yeah)

    [Pre-Chorus]
    You know some days you feel so good in your own skin
    But it's okay if you wanna change the body that you came in (Ah)
    'Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen
    We're all just playing a game in a way, trying to win at life

    [Chorus]
    Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful
    Most girls work hard, go far, we are unstoppable (Yeah, yeah)
    "Most girls": Our fight to make every day, no two are the same
    I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
    I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
    I wanna be like, I wanna be like

    [Post-Chorus]
    (They're staying out late 'cause they just celebrating)
    I wanna be like, I wanna be like
    (They're staying out late 'cause they just celebrating)
    I wanna be like, I wanna be like

    [Bridge]
    Most girls (Yeah)
    Most girls (Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be)
    Most girls, are fighting back every day, no two are the same
    I wanna be like

    [Outro]
    Most girls
    I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
    I wanna be like, I wanna be like
    (They're staying out late 'cause they just celebrating)
    I wanna be like, I wanna be like
    (They're staying out late 'cause they just celebrating)
    I wanna be like
    (They're staying out late 'cause they just celebrating life)

        <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;MEANING OF THE LYRICS &nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
    </legend>
    <pre>

        The song begins with a steady electro-pop beat and soon, Hailee's catchy vocals come in, ready to 
        smash through all the misconceptions people might have about girls today. She sings: "Some girls 
        feel best in their tiny dresses / Some girls in nothin' but sweatpants, looking like a princess / 
        Some girls kiss new lips every single night," letting her listeners know that all lifestyle 
        choices are valid. The second verse emphasizes the same mantra, reminding us that "some girls 
        like to keep their physique real private" while others "wear jeans so tight 'cause it feels so 
        right." But you can't make assumptions about people based on their clothes, and there's no "right"
        or "wrong" way to exist in your own body.

        As the song builds to its upbeat hook, Hailee begins singing about "most girls," emphasizing the 
        universal thread that exists among all women: strength and power. "Most girls are smart and strong
        and beautiful / Most girls work hard, go far, we are unstoppable / Most girls, our fight to make 
        every day / No two are the same." Her song makes the important point that everyone is different, 
        and our differences are what make us unique — but they're also what make us strong as hell. 
        You'll want to be listening to this jam all weekend for a nonstop jolt of confidence — we know 
        that's what we'll be doing.
