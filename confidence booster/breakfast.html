    [Verse 1]
    You're smoke in my hair
    Hot and dirty like the L.A. air
    That face, baby, it ain't fair
    But you don't know what you don't know
    What you don't know

    [Pre-Chorus]
    Ooh, so you wanna talk about power? (Don't you wanna talk about power?)
    Ooh, let me show you power

    [Chorus]
    I eat boys like you for breakfast
    One by one hung on my necklace
    And they'll always be mine
    It makes me feel alive (Alive)
    I eat boys like you for breakfast
    And I know that you tried your bestest
    I never said it's right
    But I'm gonna keep doing it
    
    [Verse 2]
    I'm sick, yeah, I'm sick
    And honestly, I'm getting high off it
    Do you wanna see a magic trick?
    'Cause you don't know what you don't know
    But I know
    
    [Pre-Chorus]
    Ooh, so you wanna talk about power?
    Ooh, let me show you power
    
    [Chorus]
    I eat boys like you for breakfast
    One by one hung on my necklace
    And they'll always be mine
    It makes me feel alive (Alive)
    I eat boys like you for breakfast
    And I know that you tried your bestest
    I never said it's right
    But I'm gonna keep doing it

    [Post-Chorus]
    I eat boys, I eat boys
    I eat boys, I eat boys

    [Bridge]
    You're smoke in my hair
    Hot and dirty like the L.A. air
    That face, baby, it ain't fair
    But you don't know what you don't know
    What you don't know

    I eat boys like you for breakfast
    One by one hung on my necklace
    And they'll always be mine
    It makes me feel alive
    I eat boys like you for breakfast
    And I know that you tried your bestest

        <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;MEANING OF THE LYRICS &nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
    </legend>
    <pre>

        Breakfast is a song about women's power over men. In the lyrics, Dove Cameron is challenging a guy 
        who probably wants something from her: she states that he has no control over her. She is used to 
        eating guys like him for breakfast, symbolizing her superiority over the others.

        Dove Cameron takes the topic of power as a battle between her and her man, where one will prevail 
        over the other. She says he's trying his best, meaning he wants to seduce, control, or simply make 
        her fall in love. But the singer takes it as a threat, a fight that requires her reaction. For this 
        reason, the song starts with magnetic lines where she highlights how he means nothing to her.
