    <pre>
        [Verse 1]
        Suspended in the air
        I hear myself breathing
        Hanging by a thread
        My heart is barely beating
        I haven't fallen yet
        But I feel it comin'
        Tell me would it be too much to ask
        If you break it to me gently that I'm

        [Verse 2]
        Waking the next day
        Without you beside me
        And who I hold onto today
        Tomorrow will just be a memory
        And I will look back at all of this
        And wonder why I stayed in here
        Just to watch you disappear

        [Pre-Chorus]
        So I breathe and let you go
        How do I breathe and let you go?

        [Chorus]
        Before it's too late
        I'll take a step away
        I know one word will make me go
        Rushing back to you
        So I'll just shut my eyes
        Forget that you were mine
        How do you go from making one your home
        And then just letting it all go
        Let me take it in
        Before it sinks in

        [Verse 3]
        Far beyond my reach
        Is the future you promised
        Now what I never even had
        I have every reason to miss and I
        Don't know where I could find
        The strength to let you go
        When the only life I've come to know

        [Pre-Chorus]
        Packed his bags and left me alone
        He found another home

        [Chorus]
        So before it's too late
        I'll take a step away
        I know one word will make me go
        Rushing back to you
        And I'll just shut my eyes
        Forget that you were mine
        How do you go from making one your home
        And then just letting it all go
        Let me take it in
        Before it sinks in

        [Bridge]
        Go, oohh, oohh, oohh
        Go, oohh, oohh, oohh
        Go, oohh, oohh, oohh
        Go, oohh, oohh, oohh

        [Chorus]
        Before it's too late
        I'll take a step away
        I know one word will make me go
        Rushing back to you
        I'll just shut my eyes
        Forget that you were mine
        How do you go from making one your home
        And then just letting it all go
        Let me take it in
        Before it sinks in

    <pre>

        Waiting isn't really a bad thing. That there is always hope whenever you have perseverance 
        and you are brave throughout life. Trusting Lord that whenever life's a mess, He can beautiful 
        things out of it. Our life is not only full of happiness but also anger and sadness.
