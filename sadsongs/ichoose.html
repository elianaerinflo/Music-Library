        [Verse 1]
        All of my life I thought I was right
        Looking for something new
        Stuck in my ways like old-fashioned days
        But all the roads led me to you

        [Pre-Chorus]
        The house that you live in don't make it a home
        But feeling lonely don't mean you're alone
        People in life, they will come and they'll leave
        But if I had a choice I know where I would be

        [Chorus]
        Through the lows and the highs, I will stay by your side
        There's no need for goodbyes, now I'm seeing the light
        When the sky turns to grey and there's nothing to say
        At the end of the day, I choose you

        [Verse 2]
        Now I found the strength to make a change
        And look at the magic I found
        No matter the name or where you came from
        'Cause no one has much figured out

        [Pre-Chorus]
        The house that you live in don't make it a home
        But feeling lonely don't mean you're alone
        I finally found where I feel I belong
        And I know you'll be there with wide open arms

        [Chorus]
        Through the lows and the highs, I will stay by your side
        There's no need for goodbyes, now I'm seeing the light
        When the sky turns to grey and there's nothing to say
        At the end of the day, I choose you
        I choose you

        [Bridge]
        Through the lows and the highs, I will stay by your side
        There's no need for goodbyes, now I'm seeing the light

        [Chorus]
        Through the lows and the highs, I will stay by your side
        There's no need for goodbyes, now I'm seeing the light
        When the sky turns to grey and there's nothing to say
        At the end of the day, I choose you
        Oh, I choose you
        I choose you
