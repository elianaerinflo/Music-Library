        [Verse 1]
        I fell by the wayside like everyone else
        I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself
        Our every moment, I start to replace
        'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say
        
        [Pre-Chorus]
        When you hurt under the surface
        Like troubled water running cold
        Well, time can heal but this won't

        [Chorus]
        So, before you go
        Was there something I could've said
        To make your heart beat better?
        If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
        So, before you go
        Was there something I could've said
        To make it all stop hurting?
        It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
        So, before you go

        [Verse 2]
        Was never the right time, whenever you called
        Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
        Our every moment, I start to replay
        But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

        [Pre-Chorus]
        When you hurt under the surface
        Like troubled water running cold
        Well, time can heal but this won't

        [Chorus]
        So, before you go
        Was there something I could've said
        To make your heart beat better?
        If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
        So, before you go
        Was there something I could've said
        To make it all stop hurting?
        It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
        So, before you go
        
        [Bridge]
        Would we be better off by now
        If I'd have let my walls come down?
        Maybe, I guess we'll never know
        You know, you know

        [Chorus]
        Before you go
        Was there something I could've said
        To make your heart beat better?
        If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
        So, before you go
        Was there something I could've said
        To make it all stop hurting?
        It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
        So, before you go

    </legend>
    <pre>

        Or another way of looking at it is that he is personally taking the blame for this individual leaving. 
        Sadly, Lewis Capaldi has revealed that the subject matter of this song is in fact suicide. Therefore 
        the sentiments he is relaying are from the perspective of a loved one that a victim of suicide has 
        left behind. And the loss of this individual is proving to be especially painful, as the singer 
        apparently perceives that he had an opportunity to prevent this from occurring but failed to do so. 

        So the title is based on him questioning this individual in that regard, as in if there was 
        'something he could have said' in the past to make him/her feel better and thus deter this person 
        from taking his own life. But of course if the addressee is indeed passed away, then this question 
        would be theoretically in nature, as in one the singer is asking himself in hindsight.
