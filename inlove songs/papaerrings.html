    <pre>
        [Verse 1]
        The moon is high
        Like your friends were the night that we first met
        Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
        Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
        The wine is cold
        Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
        Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
        Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe
        
        [Pre-Chorus]
        (Ayy)
        Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
        Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
        Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

        [Chorus]
        I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
        Uh huh, that's right
        Darling, you're the one I want, and
        I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
        Uh huh, that's right
        Darling, you're the one I want
        In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
        Oh, you're the one I want

        [Verse 2]
        In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
        When you jumped in first, I went in too
        I'm with you even if it makes me blue
        Which takes me back
        To the color that we painted your brother's wall
        Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
        We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

        [Pre-Chorus]
        (Ayy)
        Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
        Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
        Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
        Ah

        [Chorus]
        I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
        Uh huh, that's right
        Darling, you're the one I want, and
        I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
        Uh huh, that's right
        Darling, you're the one I want
        In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
        Oh, you're the one I want

        [Bridge]
        I want to drive away with you
        I want your complications too
        I want your dreary Mondays
        Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
        I want to drive away with you
        I want your complications too
        I want your dreary Mondays
        Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
        Uh huh

        [Chorus]
        I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
        Ah-ah, that's right, you're the one I want
        I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
        Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want
        I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
        Uh huh, that's right
        Darling, you're the one I want, and
        I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
        Uh huh, that's right
        Darling, you're the one I want
        In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
        You're the one I want
        In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
        Oh, you're the one I want

        [Outro]
        You're the one I want, one I want
        You're the one I want, one I want

        <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;MEANING OF THE LYRICS &nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
    </legend>
    <pre>

    Taylor Swift's “Paper Rings” is a touching love song in which Swift is expressing genuine sentiments 
    of lifelong devotion to her significant other. The way she does so is by using the imagery of paper 
    rings. A paper ring is of absolutely no monetary value. However, she is telling this person that she
    would marry him even if he presented her with one instead of a conventional marriage ring formed from 
    expensive materials. 
    
    Or another way of looking at it is that the songstress is not interested in deriving anything from 
    this individual outside of his love and likewise commitment. And another interesting idea she puts 
    forth is that their past failed relationships and even current “fights and flaws” actually contribute 
    to the strengthening of their union.
