    <pre>
        [Verse 1]
        I guess this is a bitter end I didn't see coming
        And I'm havin' a little bit of trouble accepting, too
        I don't know what to say to you
        There's nothing I can do to reset your point of view
        We both said this was just physical
        Well, one of us lied, can't set feelings aside, truth be told, yeah
        You asked to see me once again at half past ten
        I got nervous, so I got faded, made things complicated

        [Pre-Chorus]
        I'm sorry for the stupid shit I said
        You ordered fun, I served you threads
        It's probably good you left 'cause I finally admit

        [Chorus 1]
        I like you, I like you, I like you
        Sorry, I never meant to
        But who we kidding, it wasn't like I had a say
        One look at you and I won't have it any other way
        I want you, I want you, I want you
        I want you to want me too
        I know that I signed up for this casually
        But I fell for your tricks, now I'm the casualty

        [Hook 1]
        Can we just reset, restart and then replay
        Take me back to when all
        You wanted was to love on me every day, yeah
        I like you, I like you, I like you
        Words I won't ever hear from you
        Wishin' I could turn back the hands of time
        To when I feel your hands on me and your lips on mine

        [Verse 2]
        I know that that was too much the last time you saw me
        And I don't blame you for getting over everything so easy
        But I just can't seem to figure you out you goddamn mystery
        Good God, how you kiss me
        Didn't think it'd be distress galore
        Thought I just wanted you there
        With your hands in my hair
        But I craved more
        And you just wanted rock 'n roll, no heart and soul
        And I knew that from the beginning
        So why don't I feel like I'm winning?

        [Pre-Chorus 2]
        Ladies and gentlemen, I'm the joke
        The punchline that got too old
        It's killing me to see you gone 'cause I never told you

        [Chorus 1]
        I like you, I like you, I like you
        Sorry, I never meant to
        But who we kidding, it wasn't like I had a say
        One look at you and I won't have it any other way
        I want you, I want you, I want you
        I want you to want me too
        I know that I signed up for this casually
        But I fell for your tricks, now I'm the casualty

        [Hook 1]
        Can we just reset, restart and then replay
        Take me back to when all
        You wanted was to love on me every day, yeah
        I like you, I like you, I like you
        Words I won't ever hear from you
        Wishin' I could turn back the hands of time
        To when I feel your hands on me and your lips on mine

        [Verse 3]
        Something 'bout you makes me difficult
        But that makes us even 'cause you top of the charts
        Egotistical, it's so typical
        For me to fall for your kind
        But, oh God, I wish you were mine

        [Chorus 2]
        I like you, I like you, I like you
        Sorry, I never meant to
        But who're we kidding, it wasn't like I had a say
        One look at you and I won't have it any other way
        I want you, I want you, I want you
        I want you to want me too
        Would it be a stretch if I asked you to try again?
        I'll be patient, I swear I'll even count to ten
        One, two, three, four, five
        Fuck it

        [Hook 2]
        Can we just reset, restart and then replay (replay)
        Take me back to when all
        You wanted was to love on me every day, yeah
        I like you, I like you, I like you
        Words I won't ever hear from you (won't ever hear from you)
        Wishin' I could turn back the hands of time
        To when "I like you" was only just a secret
        Crime

        [Outro]
        Yeah, uh
