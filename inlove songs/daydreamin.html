        [Verse 1]
        You walked in
        Caught my attention
        I've never seen
        A man with so much dimension

        [Pre-Chorus]
        It's the way you walk, the way you talk
        The way you make me feel inside
        It's in your smile, it's in your eyes
        I don't wanna wait for tonight

        [Chorus]
        So I'm daydreamin'
        With my chin in the palm of my hands
        About you, you
        And only you
        Got me daydreamin'
        With my chin in the palm of my hands
        About you, you
        And only you

        [Post-Chorus]
        Fo—For you (Oh, oh, oh)
        For you (Oh, oh, oh)
        For you (Oh, oh, oh)
        For you (Oh, oh)

        [Verse 2]
        Now I can't wait
        To hold you in my arms
        I know I was made for you
        I'm in love with all your charm
        
        [Pre-Chorus]
        It's the way you walk, the way you talk
        The way you make me feel inside
        It's in your smile, it's in your eyes
        I don't wanna wait for tonight

        [Chorus]
        So I'm daydreamin'
        With my chin in the palm of my hands
        About you, you
        And only you
        Got me daydreamin'
        With my chin in the palm of my hands
        About you, you
        And only you

        [Bridge]
        Oh, I want ya
        Gotta have ya
        And I need you
        Like I've never had lovin' before
        Oh, I want ya
        Ou, I need you
        Gotta have ya
        Like I've never had lovin' before

        [Chorus]
        So I'm daydreamin'
        With my chin in the palm of my hands
        About you, you
        And only you
        Got me daydreamin'
        With my chin in the palm of my hands
        About you, you
        And only you

        [Post-Chorus]
        Fo—For you (Oh, oh, oh)
        For you (Oh, oh, oh)
        For you (Oh, oh, oh)
        For you (Oh, oh)
