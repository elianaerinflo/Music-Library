        [Verse 1]
        I got this feelin' inside my bones
        It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
        All through my city, all through my home
        We're flyin' up, no ceilin', when we in our zone
        
        [Refrain]
        I got that sunshine in my pocket, got that good soul in my feet
        I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (Ooh)
        I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally
        Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
        [Pre-Chorus]
        And under the lights when everything goes
        Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close
        When we move, well, you already know
        So just imagine (Just imagine, just imagine)
        
        [Chorus]
        Nothin' I can see but you
        When you dance, dance, dance
        A feelin' good, good, creepin' up on you
        So just dance, dance, dance, come on
        All those things I shouldn't do
        But you dance, dance, dance
        And ain't nobody leavin' soon, so keep dancin'
        
        [Post-Chorus]
        I can't stop the feelin'
        So just dance, dance, dance
        I can't stop the feelin'
        So just dance, dance, dance, come on
        
        [Verse 2]
        Ooh, it's somethin' magical
        It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushin' on (Rushin' on)
        I don't need no reason, don't need control (Need control)
        I fly so high, no ceilin', when I'm in my zone

        [Refrain]
        'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket, got that good soul in my feet
        I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (Ooh)
        I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally
        Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

        <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;MEANING OF THE LYRICS &nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
    </legend>
    <pre>

    In this case, “the feeling” which Justin Timberlake is referring to which is compelling 
    him to dance, he likens it to some type of electricity surging through his body. As 
    revealed in the refrain, this sensation is actually indicative of a generally upbeat 
    mood that he's in. 

    It can also be interpreted as having some type of amorous undertone, i.e. he being 
    'hot-blooded'. And such an idea is especially plausible when you take into the 
    consideration that in the choruses he appears to be, at least to some degree, 
    addressing a romantic interest.

    But this isn't so much about JT gawking at a lady dancing, as the chorus implies. Or 
    rather let's say that the other parts of the song besides the choruses don't have 
    anything to do with romance. 

    So all lyrics considered, perhaps we can safely make the presumption that the most 
    setting upon which this narrative is set is a dance club or if not some instance 
    where a female is also present.
