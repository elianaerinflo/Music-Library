        <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;MEANING OF THE LYRICS &nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
    </legend>
    <pre>
        
        "Better When I'm Dancin'" was inspired by Trainor's fans, who "make [her] feel like a star 
        on that stage". The song is about confidence and releasing your insecurities on the dance 
        floor, and has been described as a "classic confidence-boosting tune".

        Trainor revealed that she was recording the song for The Peanuts Movie soundtrack. According 
        to her, she was approached to soundtrack the film due to her ability to write "a song about 
        confidence".
